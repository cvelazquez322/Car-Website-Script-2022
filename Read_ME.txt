The following script is a webscraper I built using Python3 and Selenium.

A used car dealership contracted me to build a scrapper which downloads all cars they buy from an auction. 
The information they wanted was the VIN, odometer reading, year, make and model of the car, as well as any pictures related to the car. 

I've edited out the dealership website name, their login information, as well as the location on my hard drive that saves their information, 
as this also had their dealership name.
